## ‚ú® Features & Technical Focus

This menu template is engineered for optimal user experience and front-end performance, specifically addressing the needs of RTL design:

* **RTL Language Support:** The entire layout, including text alignment, icons, and menu navigation flow, is structured using modern CSS properties (like `direction: rtl` and logical properties like `margin-inline-start`) to ensure a native experience for Persian and other RTL languages.
* **Responsive Layout:** The design uses a **Mobile-First** approach, ensuring rapid loading and a clean presentation on the smallest screens before progressively enhancing the experience for larger devices.
* **CSS Flexbox Implementation:** Leverages **Flexbox** to handle the alignment, spacing, and dynamic distribution of menu items (e.g., placing items, descriptions, and prices).
* **Clear Information Hierarchy:** Uses strong typography and spacing to ensure the user can quickly scan and find prices and item details.
* **Technology:** HTML5 and CSS3 (Vanilla).
